# Remote code execution vulnerability affecting Mavenir IP-SM-GW MCO

[Mavenir](https://mavenir.com/) sells MCO product which serves as IP-SM-GW to deliver SMS over IMS service to VoLTE users.

An end-to-end vulnerability has been discovered on MCO product, rated as high (score 8.1, CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

The vulnerability has been fixed, and vulnerable systems shall now have been patched - according to vendor answer.

## SMSoIP at a glance

When UE sends a short message, it is carried through IMS to IP-SM-GW, and next to SMS-C, ensuring interoperability with legacy subsystems:

```

Due to the way SMS over IP works, UE controls RP-DATA, and **IMS merely routes RP-DATA to IP-SM-GW**. Hence a vulnerability on IP-SM-GW would become exploitable from UE. Such a vulnerability has been discovered, and an end-to-end exploit has been successfully achieved. Any attacker with a SMSoIP enabled profile may trigger remote code execution on IP-SM-GW MCO.

## Vulnerability details

The version on which the vulnerability has been discovered is R3.0-10.09.B09. Vendor has issued ticket reference MCO-6083 to track and correct this vulnerability. A fix has been supplied by the vendor and tested, in version R3.0-10.12.B11. We encourage all operators who have this solution deployed in their network to ensure they are not vulnerable to this issue.

The process that handles SIP messages on MCO is `scn`, which runs under unprivileged account `mco`. To our knowledge, all functional processes run under `mco` account, which means that all the signalling traffic passing through IP-SM-GW, personal data associated with short messages â€“ recipient & sender, date and time, content - , and configuration files are at risk.
